Can you please look at the c++ code for this demo? These images should be identical. The left is the c++ sample and the right rust is our rust version. They should have a lower left origin with the canvas inverted by having  the y * -1. All the controls from the c++ version need to be implement exactly and work both on the canvas (will need to invert mouse y) and on the right .js.
